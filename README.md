Description

Everybody hates those irrelevant or inappropriate „Spams“, that people post on social networks. I created a console application, that process tweets of a given account on Twitter. The app should determine whether the given account is annoying „Spamer“ or not. After the decision is made, the result is shown with some more specific data about the found „spam phrases“ in the tweets. The aplication focuses only on commercial offer spams.
